# ðŸ”° JavaScript Documentation Standards
JSDoc is a markup language used to annotate JavaScript source code files. Using comments containing JSDoc, programmers can add documentation describing the application programming interface of the code they're creating.

More info: [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)

### SINGLE LINE COMMENTS
```js
/** Extract the array values. */
```

### MULTI-LINE COMMENTS
```js
/**
 * This is a comment that is long enough to warrant being stretched over
 * the span of multiple lines. You'll notice this follows basically
 * the same format as the JSDoc wrapping and comment block style.
 */
```

### FUNCTIONS
```js
/**
  * @function getFileName
  *
  * @description Returns the simple file-name based on full path
  *
  * @param {string} filePath - the file path
  *
  * @returns {string}
  *
  */
```
